# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for CIFAR-10 Image Classification

## Overview
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images from hand-written CIFAR-10 datasets. The dataset was divided into two subsets: one for training and the other for testing. The CNN model was employed for both subsets.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy rate of 79.8%. It's worth noting that the images used for training were small and gray scale, leading to high computational time compared to normal JPEG images.

## Improvements
To improve the accuracy of image classification, several enhancements can be implemented:
- **Add More Layers:** Increasing the depth of the CNN model by adding more layers can capture more complex features.
- **Larger Image Data:** Training the network with more extensive image data using clusters of GPUs can enhance the model's performance.
  
## Future Directions
In the future, the focus will be on:
- **Classifying Larger Color Images:** This will be particularly useful for image segmentation processes, where finer details and color information are crucial.
